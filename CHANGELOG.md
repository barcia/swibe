## 3.0.0
I rewrite the code from scratch again, but this time putting all UI settings,
transitions, etc, in CSS3. Now the Swibe menu is great and works perfectly.
:smiley:


## 2.0.0
I started to see the light. The menu was coded from scratch in vanilla
JavaScript, but with many settings and styles in JS... Bad thing. :sweat:


## 1.0.0
Time ago were dark times... I used huge things like jQ***y to create a
*overcoded* and inefficient menu. :smiling_imp:
